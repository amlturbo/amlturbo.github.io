If you are interested in understanding your carbon, waste, social impact footprint, etc, there are many brands and businesses with strategies aimed at capturing your dollars while also achieving your altruistic aims. There are examples of firms that have knit ESG goals into the fabric of their organizations, and then there are firms that see the marketing campaigns as a value creator and hop on the bandwagon. My goal here is to unpack some of our options, dive deeper into what those options achieve, and discuss what solution might be the most optimal if making sustainable decisions in our everyday lives is the goal. I want to look past the marketing and fully understand whether our decisions could possibly make an impact. 

I am by no means an expert, however I do have a background that lends itself to analyzing these topics. Because I am passionate about protecting the future of our planet, I want to do all that I can to achieve that, and encourage others to do the same. I have invested time in understanding these concepts because I want to be sure that I am actually making what I believe to be the best decision, and not to simply think that I am. I hope that compiling this research and performing the more in-depth analyses in this blog can help others as well. I hope that this information, data, and analysis allows others to better understand the options before them, and choose what they feel is best.

If you have any ideas, suggestions, or just want to reach out, please contact me via [email](mailto:sustainabilityinthebalance@gmail.com).
