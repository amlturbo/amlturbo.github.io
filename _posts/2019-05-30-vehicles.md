In my [previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-04-10-ethanol %}), I discussed the introduction and rise of ethanol as a fuel in the US, and the impact on carbon emissions that it may have had. I touched on the topic of flex-fuel vehicles (FFVs), and wanted to get to the bottom of what lead to their ubiquitousness in the current pool of vehicles. 

Nearly 10% of cars on the road can be fueled with E85, however there are only 4,500 stations across the country that offer it, while there are approximately 150,000 gas stations. Thus we can assume few FFV owners are actually fueling with E85, and as a result, we are not achieving the carbon reduction benefit that they could have provided. This led me to the broader question of what or who determines the vehicle choices put before us as consumers, and do we even have much of a say? 

There have been and continue to be many different interests that come into play in determining what vehicle technologies and body-styles are on offer to consumers. I will touch on each of the following interests in this post:
* Oil companies
* Car manufacturers
* Regulatory
* Consumers
 
All of these interests end up being intertwined, and it is difficult to separate which group really benefits from each argument, since one group can claim another is harmed by excessive or permissive regulation.

## Oil Interests
Oil companies of course have a vested interest in maintaining strong demand for any and all of their products. It is worth keeping in mind that because a barrel of oil produces many different products, (propane, butane, gasoline, jet, diesel, heavy shipping fuel oils, asphalt, petroleum coke, to name a few), a change in demand for any one product will not necessarily mean that the economics of processing that barrel of crude have changed. If diesel demand remains heavy while gasoline demand falls, as has happened in Europe, refineries will continue to operate, with diesel production maximized. Other products are still sold, however they may command a much lower price than in a more favorable economic environment. In the end, while a shift in the transportation fuels market may change the economics of how the products in a barrel of crude are split, it does not necessarily mean that the crude will stay in the ground.

It has been made clear that oil companies [are indeed pushing against increasing the CAFE standards](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/are-weaker-fuel-efficiency-standards-based-on-faulty-logic/), which is to be expected given what I said above. It is the role of our EPA [to protect its citizens](https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/aboutepa/our-mission-and-what-we-do_.html), and manage the difficult balance of maintaining business competition while protecting the rights of individuals. This gets complicated quickly: A lot of money and jobs are potentially at stake, and each stakeholder will emphasize its case to regulators. Continuing the status quo ensures that the existing system continues business-as-usual, including the continued damage to our environment, while upending the status quo could lead to innovation and birth of new businesses and jobs, but with some transitional upheaval that would require government intervention to manage. 

## Regulatory Interests
Since it is the role of government to protect the individual, designing policy that does not discriminate against one group over another is no easy task. A few ways federal regulators have thus far managed and balanced the differing interests is through many, many different rules and regulations, each with its own focus on either the supply or the demand side of the equation. A few of the big ones to call out are:  
* **CAFE standards** lead car manufacturers to take responsibility for a greater proportion of the lifecycle cost and environmental and economic impacts of operating a vehicle
* **Tax incentives** promote alternative vehicle ownership by consumers
* The **Renewable Fuels Standard** has led to new products being a part of the overall fuel pool

## Customer Interest
Some of the analysis and arguments seem to suggest that customer choices take place in a vacuum, that car company or dealership strategies do not persuade customers one way or another. In reality, customers are choosing from the selection placed before them. If a particular company does not offer a car of the right size or shape that the customer prefers (elevated position, hatchback, third row seating, etc), the customer will not demand it of them and hold their dollars until it is created. They will go to another source and purchase what they find to be the ideal product to meet their needs. One key component of making this decision is the price: And car companies know this. We have all heard the car commercials that state lease prices, 0% interest rates, “zero due at signing”, and other financial incentives. A customer may be willing to make concessions in one area or another in order to pay less for a vehicle, particularly if they feel as though they are getting "more car for their dollar," as could be the case with larger vehicles, like SUVs. 

## Car Manufacturer Interests
Thinking about what motivates car companies at a high level, a few things stand out. Consumer taste of course, although as I just discussed, this can be manipulated by what is on offer. Margins and sales volumes are certainly important, as is ensuring consistent demand, through attractive features like new technologies such as safety and collision avoidance systems. Ultimately, management of most companies, both within and outside the auto industry, is driven by what is best for the shareholder, which means that earnings must be maximized in order to increase stock prices.

Car manufacturers make a [higher margin on SUV and crossover vehicles than they do on sedans or small economy cars](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/06/how-the-carmakers-trumped-themselves/562400/). SUVs and crossovers are less fuel efficient than lighter, smaller, more aerodynamic vehicles, but, conveniently for car companies, the CAFE standards are also less strict. 

Today’s CAFE standards include really two separate standards for light duty vehicles: One for short and one for long wheelbases. Long wheelbases mean that the total footprint of the car is larger (vehicle width * wheelbase = footprint). A larger footprint car has much lower mpg targets than a smaller footprint car. As a result, car manufacturers were likely balancing many different factors to meet CAFE targets at the least cost. 

Through this simple example, we could see how auto manufacturers may be incentivized to promote slightly different models than what one might at first think when considering the CAFE standards. In fact, [VW argued](https://web.archive.org/web/20111003154125/http://www.volkswagengroupamerica.com/newsroom/2011/07/29_vwag_proposed_cafe_standards.htm) in 2011 that creating two categories with their own targets would result in firms producing and heavily marketing larger SUV and light trucks, negating any effort to reduce overall emissions. And while we can probably agree that VW [might not be the most honest voice when it comes to vehicle emissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal), the argument [may still have merit](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/06/how-the-carmakers-trumped-themselves/562400/). The fact that [Ford recently announced](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2018/04/26/ford-has-been-synonymous-with-cars-for-more-than-a-century-thats-about-to-change/?utm_term=.3f95607af981) that it will no longer produce sedans (although they are hoping to introduce 16 battery powered models by 2022, which is when the next round of CAFE standards would start) seems to be in line with this thinking. 

## Analysis - Gasoline Demand

If we start on the oil side of the equation, we can begin by looking into the gasoline demand over time. The data below has been seasonally adjusted using the [statsmodels library in Python](https://machinelearningmastery.com/decompose-time-series-data-trend-seasonality/) in order to better identify the trends in the data.

*Source: [EIA](http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_cons_wpsup_k_4.htm) and [Renewable Fuels Association](https://ethanolrfa.org/resources/industry/statistics/#1549569747568-e7db9c54-efe4)*

We can see that there is a very consistent, steady increase in consumption from 1990 through 2007, a period of nearly 20 years. There is then a drop in finished gasoline consumption around the onset of the economic crisis in 2007. Some of this was driven by high crude prices (and subsequent high product prices), and some was driven by reduced economic activity. Consumption continued to fall until 2012, when the trend reverses. Then in early 2016 the curve flattens. There are many economic factors that have lead to this current flat consumption.

If we look at finished gasoline sales alongside the historical US population, we see what appears to be a shift in consumption per capita. The upward trend in consumption followed population until the reset in 2007, and the steepness of the trend has not returned. It is probably safe to infer that, independent of all the factors influencing this course, oil companies are pretty interested in at least maintaining the demand they see today.

## Analysis - Alternative Fuel Technology
Switching gears a bit and looking into what vehicle models have been available over time for customers interested in alternative fuels, we get the graph shown below.   

![image-center]({{ site.baseurl }}
/assets/images/modelsovertime.png){: .align-center}

We see compressed natural gas (CNG) with an early start, followed by electric and E85 vehicles. The early introduction of electric vehicles (EVs) around 1997 and their subsequent disappearance for many years is a curious development, one that was likely impacted by each of the interests discussed above. It is also the topic of a 2006 documentary [Who Killed the Electric Car](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Killed_the_Electric_Car%3F), currently available for streaming on Prime, and is worth watching if you are interested in learning more. EVs re-emerge in force in 2012, and throughout this time period, we see the vast number of E85 vehicles available to consumers. 

Looking deeper at which companies drove the availability of E85 “technology” (in quotes, since it really is not technology at all, but a slightly different engine tuning), in the graph below we see that in 2018, American car makers were leaning heavily on the car type, while others relied on hybrid or plug-in electrics.

But what did the offerings of some of the biggest manufacturers look like over time? The figure below picks out a couple to look into in more depth.

We see here how differently each automaker approached the CAFE standards. Some, because their existing fleets consisted of small and innately fuel efficient models to begin with, did not begin offering alternative technologies until much later than others, as the targets continued getting stricter. Some, like the big American automakers, relied heavily on FFVs, and, by comparison, have few electric or hybrid vehicles. Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, by contrast, have, throughout this same time period, marketed hybrid vehicles. Nissan, with the introduction of the Leaf in 2011, appears on the electric car scene and has only increased the number of configurations of the Leaf technology since. It is worth noting that auto companies with small market share that tended towards niche sport vehicles (Porche, Mercedes, Fiat, and others) chose to pay the fines rather than comply with the regulations.

The number of FFVs has taken a nosedive since around 2015, likely driven by the calculation change in the CAFE standards. Up until 2015, [the rule](https://one.nhtsa.gov/staticfiles/rulemaking/pdf/cafe/2017-25_CAFE_Final_Rule.pdf) stated that ethanol contributed zero emissions, and that car companies could count E85 vehicles towards their standards, regardless of whether those vehicles were actually running on E85 or not. Beginning in model year 2016, manufacturers must calculate flex-fuel vehicle emissions using actual data on E85/gasoline sales or use, rather than assuming all drivers are opting for the ethanol fuel.

Because it would likely be costly to manage and maintain reliable data on E85 sales in its cars, carmakers have begun abandoning the FFV strategy and instead are implementing "new" technologies. Turbochargers, for example, while more commonly known for providing added power and speed to sporty cars, can also provide [added power to small engines](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimhenry/2012/02/28/turbocharging-to-save-gas-instead-of-to-go-fast/#31b163383a6b), allowing a heavier car to be fitted with a smaller engine, reducing its fuel consumption. However, this added equipment leads to added cost, which may have been the reason why some automakers held off on this strategy until more recently, once they were essentially forced to in order to achieve the CAFE targets.

## Bringing it all together
It is difficult to separate and understand what weight each of the interests has had on the current and future vehicle products on offer. It seems safe to say, given all of the information presented above, that the ongoing tug-of-war centers around regulators and car manufacturers. As would be the case for most firms, when presented with a set of increasingly stringent regulations, the firm will analyze all potential means of meeting those regulations and will choose the option that results in the lowest cost, and maybe only the lowest cost in the short term. Few managers would volunteer to be the one to choose a costly, long term strategy especially in an uncertain regulatory environment like this one. There is no guarantee that the targets outlined in a regulation are implemented as written, since they are periodically reviewed. 

The current administration has put on hold any additional increases in fuel economy targets. While one might think this would be welcome news to some stakeholders, when the announcement was made in August 2018, car manufacturers were not pleased. [Some speculate](https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/are-weaker-fuel-efficiency-standards-based-on-faulty-logic/) this could be because halting fuel economy improvements goes against car companies' increasingly eco-oriented marketing. These companies may also want to distance themselves from the current administration. And while federal fuel economy standards may have been put on hold, California is continuing forward stricter requirements for cars sold in the state, which means many car companies will be required to pursue fuel economy improvements as they initially intended.

## Rise of EVs
*Insert discussion on carbon impact of EVs - charging off coal vs gasoline car*

## Conclusion
The chart below from [Bloomberg New Energy Finance](https://bnef.turtl.co/story/evo2018?teaser=true) projects the oil products displaced globally by EVs by 2040. The US portion is estimated to be 2.3 million barrels per day of gasoline which seems inconsequential given that our current gasoline demand is between 250 and 300 million barrels per day. They also project that by 2025, EVs will make up 11% of new passenger vehicle sales, increasing over time as EVs become cheaper than ICEs by 2030.

[According to McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-global-electric-vehicle-market-is-amped-up-and-on-the-rise), global automakers will introduce 340 electric and plug-in hybrid electric models between 2018 and 2021, and adoption is taking off in some countries, with ambitious targets in place that will lead to EV adoption in China and several European countries. While there is a considerable way to go before widespread adoption in the U.S. can take place, there is certainly momentum. Current EV charging infrastructure is increasing rapidly, and is widely available already, as the chart below shows.

![image-center]({{ site.baseurl }}

While no one can predict the future, given the current momentum and automaker plans, it seems that EVs will continue to hold a larger and larger portion of the total fleet in the US, regardless of the short-term future of the CAFE standards. As the infrastructure continues to expand, as technology prices continue to fall, and as global adoption increases, the EV movement will shift from nascent to mainstream. Even oil companies seem to be recognizing the shift, and have [begun adding charging infrastructure into their long term strategies](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/shells-electric-mobility-strategy-focuses-on-fleets#gs.7jpcqt). It will be an exciting next few years in the transportation space as innovation and new technologies make their way onto the roads around us.
